# Shared Schedule

## Project Info
This is the Shared Schedule project, developed as a team of 3 for QHacks 2021. The idea of the project is a website that generates a weekly schedule, which can be accessed by others and see the same information. A user would input their name and then fill in which time slots of the week they are busy/available. The website updates the database syncronously, so all other users of the website will be able to see the same schedule that everyone else fills out.

##Idea Generation
The idea for this project came up when one of our team members wanted to have a shared schedule between his housemates so that people will know when to be quiet. The problem being solved with this application is having tests/exams for online school, but other people in your house are being loud because they didn't know of the test/exam. With this website, all of the housemates will be able to visit the same site, and each fill in when they want quite times. This solves the problem withought having to write out a schedule on a whiteboard, or go through more complicated steps with a shared calendar app like Google Calender.
